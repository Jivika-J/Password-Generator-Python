Password Generator (Python)

This is a simple password generator written in Python.  
It lets the user create strong passwords by choosing the length and the type of characters to include.

I built this project to practice Python basics like functions, conditionals, loops, and working with built-in libraries.




What it does
- Generates a password of any length
- Lets the user choose whether to include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Makes sure at least one character from each selected type is included




Technologies used
- Python 3
- Built-in Python modules (`random`, `string`)



How to run the program
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal inside the project folder.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python password_generator.py
